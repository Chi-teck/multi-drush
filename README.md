# MultiDrush

A simple way to run multiple Drush versions on the same server.


## Installation
Download the [drush.phar](https://github.com/Chi-teck/multi-drush/releases/download/1.0.0/drush.phar) file. Rename the file to _drush_, make it executable, and move it to any folder that is in your PATH.

```bash
wget https://github.com/Chi-teck/multi-drush/releases/download/1.0.0/drush.phar
chmod +x drush.phar
sudo mv drush.phar /usr/local/bin/drush
```
